ðŸ§® Tkinter-Based Calculator Application (Python GUI Project)
Built a fully functional GUI Calculator using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. This application performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with additional features like:
âœ… Interactive button-based input
âœ… Clear and Backspace functionalities
âœ… Error handling for invalid expressions
âœ… Custom-styled interface with place() geometry for precise layout
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
Python, Tkinter, eval(), GUI components like Entry, Label, and Button
ðŸ’¡ Project Highlights:
Implemented a real-time input system using lambda functions.
Used the eval() function to parse and compute expressions.
Designed for clean usability and user experience within a 500x500 px window.
This project enhanced my understanding of event-driven programming and GUI layout management in Python.
